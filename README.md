Create your first HPC cluster and configure it to allow AiiDA to connect to it.
2. [Connecting AiiDA to the HPC:](Section2/connecting-aiida.md) connect to the cluster from an AiiDA docker container and run a first calculation. 
3. [Installing software on the cluster](Section3/installing-software.md) and running more advanced calculations
4. [Advanced HPC clusters:](Section4/advanced-clusters.md) spot instances and how to manage a cluster with multiple partitions and queues with AiiDA.
