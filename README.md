# AiiDA-on-AWS
In the following guide you will be introduced to setting up an HPC on AWS. We will use AiiDA to connect to the cluster from a docker container and run a first calculation. Then we will turn our attention to installing software on the HPC and run a more advanced calculation. Finally, we will discuss more advanced HPC clusters. We will cover spot instances and how to manage a cluster with multiple partitions and queues with AiiDA.

In this section you will create your first HPC cluster and configure it to allow AiiDA to connect to it.
