# Connecting AiiDA to the cluster
There are many options as to how AiiDA can be run. In the following we will run AiiDA from our cloud9 instance using a docker container. You could just as well install AiiDA natively in the same VM (e.g. using [this](https://galaxy.ansible.com/marvel-nccr/aiida) ansible) or run from your local machine.

## 1.1. Downloading and configuring the AiiDA container
Before we start connecting AiiDA with our HPC we need to setup and configure the container from which we will be running AiiDA.
